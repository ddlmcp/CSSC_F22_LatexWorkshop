## Presentation
The introductory presentation is primarily taken from [this github repository](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course) under a permissive MIT license.

We will introduce the absolute basics of using LaTeX, mathematic typesettings, environments and packages.
Then we will disscuss document structures with figures, references, and custom commands for creating reports from tempates.
We will then touch on advanced capabilities like creating presentations or posters with Beamer or diagrams and figures using TikZ.
Ultimately we will ensure everyone is pointed to the resources to implement whatever they want to create with LaTeX.


## Walkthrough
For begineers, we will be starting by completing Overleaf's [Learn LaTeX in 30 Minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) tutorial.

For those beyond the basics, we'll help people progress on their own projects or more advanced features from templates.
