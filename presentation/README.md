Additional Slides
------

These slides have been modified from the course provided in [this github repository](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course) under a permissive MIT license.

The aim is to get students writing in LaTeX as quickly as possible. 
The material is presented as a set of examples, and broader concepts and techniques are explained as they arise. 
Each part includes exercises that can be completed on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), the free online LaTeX editor, so you don't have to worry about getting LaTeX and related tools installed on everyone's computers.

The following slides were the original source material separated into these three parts:

1. [The Basics](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part1.pdf): ideas, syntax, equations, environments, packages

2. [Structed Documents & More](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part2.pdf): titles, sections, cross-references, figures, tables, bibliographies.

3. [Not Just Papers: Presentations & More](http://jdleesmiller.github.io/latex-course/en/part3.pdf): recap exercise, presentations with beamer, drawings with tikz.
